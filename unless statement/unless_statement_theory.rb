UNLESS STATEMENT
This statement is executed when the given condition is false.
In unless statement, the block executes once when the given condition is false.
Unless statement is used when we require to print false condition

IF STATEMENT
This statement is executed when the given condition is true.
In if statement, the block executes once when the given condition is true.
If statement is used when we require to print true condition
-------------------------------------------------------
we cannot use if statement and 'or' operator to print false statements because if statement and or operator always works on true condition.
