#Executes code if conditional is false.If the conditional is true,code specified in the else clause is executed.
#unless is opposite of if statement
#unless = അങ്ങനെ അല്ലെങ്കിൽ
#if = അങ്ങനെ ആണെങ്കിൽ
x=1
unless x>=2
	puts "X is less than 2"
else
	puts "X is greater than 2"
end

#1 is not >= 2 so the condition is false hence it prints X is less than 2
#if x=3 then the condition true hence else clause will execute
