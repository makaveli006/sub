=begin
Objects are created from classes. Think of classes as molds and objects as the things you produce out of those molds.
Individual objects will contain different information (a string may contain integer) from other objects, yet they are instances of the same class.
Here's an example of two objects of the String class.
Ruby defines the attributes and behaviors of its objects in classes.
You can think of classes as basic outlines of what an object should be made of and what it should be able to do.
We use the reserved word end to finish the definition of methods,loops,class etc
