Variables are a named reference to a place in the computer’s memory.
You use variables to store data and retrieve it later.

=end

# To store a string in a variable, define the variable name and assign the string’s value.

my_string = "Hello guyzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

# Then, to retrieve the value, use the variable’s name.

puts my_string

To test this out yourself, create the file string_variables.rb in your editor with the following command.
$ nano string_variables.rb

=end

my_name = "Sammy the Shark"
my_age = "none of your business"

puts my_name
puts my_age

=begin
This program defines two variables: my_name and my_age.
Each variable is assigned a string.
We then use the puts method to print out each string on its own line.

By assigning strings to variables, you can avoid typing the same string over and over each time you want to use it, making it easier to work with and manipulate strings in your programs.
