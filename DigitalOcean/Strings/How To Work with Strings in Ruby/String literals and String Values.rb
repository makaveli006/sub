Notice that all the strings you’ve created are enclosed in quotes in the code, but the actual printed output does not include the quotation marks.

There is a distinction when referring to each of these. A string literal is the string as it is written in the source code, including quotations. A string value is what you see in the output, and does not include quotations.

This is a string literal:

"Sammy the Shark"
The string value would be Sammy the Shark.

In most cases, you won’t have to worry about this difference, unless you want to use special characters like quotation marks or apostrophes in your strings.
