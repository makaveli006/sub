#  Find the word 'like'

=begin
Cats != cats in RegEx
This returns the index of the first occurrence(If there is 2 like's then the first like index will be taken) of the word if it was found (successful match) or nil otherwise.
If we donâ€™t care about the index we could use the String#include? method.[puts "Do you love cats?".include?("love")]
If index is present then it is a success match, if "nil" shows up then it is not a success match.

=end

var = "Do you like like cats?" =~ /like/
puts var
p var

#---------------------------------------------

var2 = "Do you love cats?" =~ /like/
puts var2 # Here nothing prints
p var2


puts "Do you love cats?".include?("love")
