Axlsx is an Office Open XML Spreadsheet generator for the Ruby programming language.
With Axlsx you can create excel worksheets with charts, images (with links),
automated and fixed column widths, customized styles, functions, tables,
conditional formatting, print options, comments, merged cells, auto filters,
file and stream serialization as well as full schema validation.
Axlsx excels at helping you generate beautiful Office Open XML Spreadsheet documents without having to understand the entire ECMA specification.

*Libre Office

You must specify colors for your series. see examples/chart_colors.rb for an example.
You must use data in your sheet for charts. You cannot use hard coded values.
Chart axis and gridlines do not render. I have a feeling this is related to themes, which axlsx does not implement at this time.
*Google Docs

Images are known to not work with google docs
border colors do not work
