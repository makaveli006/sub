let radius = 5
const pi = 3.14
let area
// if i want to change the value of radius variable i will be doing like this
radius = 9  // you dont use let keyword again here
// if i initialize pi = 5 now code will get error (Assignment to constant variable) bcz pi is constant.


area = pi * radius * radius
console.log(area)
